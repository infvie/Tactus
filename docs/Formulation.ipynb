    "Most computing clusters are homogenous in the sense that they are composed of chipsets that are uniform in power draw. This unifomity makes it easy to load balance along the leads in a PDU. The load balancing amongst heterogenous clusters quickly becomes non-trivial and leads to safety issues. In this formulation, we construct a generalized solution to this load balancing problem using mixed integer programming."
